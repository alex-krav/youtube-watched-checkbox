# YouTube Watched Checkbox
Google Chrome extension for manual selection of YouTube watched videos.

## What for?
YouTube marks watched videos with red progress line, thus showing you videos, you've already watched.

There are Chrome Extensions available, that add 'Watched' label and darken thumbnails depending on how much of video you already watched.

However, there are cases, that are not covered with above functionality:
- you've seen this video elsewhere (another device, account, or offline)
- you are familiar with information (lecture on something you already know)
- you watched a part of video and decided that it's enough

Marked videos won't scatter your attention when searching for something or browsing channel or playlist videos.

## Main functionality
- Installing extension via Chrome Web Store
- Marking videos as 'Done' or unmarking them back
- Data is saved in Chrome Storage

## Supported pages
- YouTube homepage
